# Hello! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

# What is LiteScript
LiteScript is a pretty flexible, fun and beginner friendly language. And we have some syntaxes from other languages: Python, JavaScript and Lua. LiteScript has tons of cool commands, go do them yourself!!

# How do I start using it?
<p>
If you want to start learning about it, then go to the LiteScript documentations and a big thanks for using my language ðŸ˜„!!

To run a '.lite' file, you would need to run this command on the shell: `lite("filenamehere.lite")`, and thats it. But if the file is on a folder, what I should do? Simple! just do: `lite("foldernamehere/filenamehere.lite")`
</p>

# What are those commands
Some of them are:

`print`, Example:

code:
```
print("Hello World!"); # The semi-colon or ; is not really needed or optional
```

shell:

```cmd
print("Hello World!")
```

`expressions`, Example:

code (with variables and a print):
```
var sum = 1 + 2
print(sum)
```

shell:
```cmd
1 + 2
```

And more...

# I do not understand something
