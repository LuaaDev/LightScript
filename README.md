# Hello! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">

# What is LightScript
LightScript is a pretty flexible, fun and beginner friendly language like. And we have some syntaxes from other languages like: Python, JavaScript and Lua. LightScript has tons of cool commands!

# What are those commands
Some of them are:

`print`, Example:

code:
```
print("Hello World!"); # The semi-colon or ; is not really needed or optional
```

shell:

```cmd
print("Hello World!")
```

`expressions`, Example:

code (with variables and a print):
```
var sum = 1 + 2
print(sum)
```

shell:
```cmd
1 + 2
```

And more...

# How do I begin?
<p>
If you want to start learning about it, I would recommend going to the LightScript docs and a big thanks from Luaa for using my language ðŸ˜ƒ
</p>

# I do not understand anything
<p>
Do not worry!
