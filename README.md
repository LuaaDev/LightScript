# What is LiteScript
LiteScript is a pretty flexible, fun and beginner friendly language like. And we have some syntaxes from other languages like: Python, JavaScript and Lua. LiteScript has tons of cool commands!

# What are those commands
Some of them are:

`print`, Example:

code:
```
print("Hello World!"); # The semi-colon or ; is not really needed or optional
```

shell:

```cmd
print("Hello World!")
```

`expressions`, Example:

code (with variables and a print):
```
var sum = 1 + 2
print(sum)
```

shell:
```cmd
1 + 2
```

And more...
